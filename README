2. cat configure.options
    MACOSXX86 OPENGL TCL NOSTATICPLUGINS 
# OPENGL must provided, otherwise cannot invoke x11.
# NOSTATICPLUGINS remove errors, otherwise: 
# PluginMgr.C:34:10: fatal error: 'libmolfile_plugin.h' file not found
# TCL is needed, otherwise cannot load the main program.
# On MacOS, tcl8.5 should be compiled from source, to obtain libtcl8.5-x11.a file. 
# However, I haven't test that.
